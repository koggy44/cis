            Campus Incident System facilitates incident reporting procedure. The system has a powerful facility 
            which links the user to the administrator or the system as a whole using a selection parameter. 
            CIS solves the ineffectiveness in dealing with incidents in our campus today. 

            CIS is a custom friendly system. The system is designed ultimately to drive students’ service who are 
            the main character in our campuses and improve communications services and interactivity with 
            administration whenever an incident occurs. Incident system seeks to advice on the establishment 
            of an appropriate framework, within which one achieves the set out objectives of reporting an 
            incident and particularly to have regard to the purpose for which the system is held.
